# Diabetes_Prediction
The Diabetes Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model utilizing machine learning techniques to identify individuals at risk of diabetes. Leveraging the power of Support Vector Machines (SVM), the project employs a robust classification algorithm to analyze patient data and make accurate predictions regarding the likelihood of diabetes.
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the SVM Model:

# bash
Copy code
python src/diabetes_prediction.py
# Dataset
The dataset (data/diabetes_dataset.csv) contains the following columns:

# Glucose: Blood glucose level.
BloodPressure: Blood pressure measurement.
BMI: Body Mass Index.
...
# Results
The SVM model achieved commendable accuracy in predicting diabetes within the dataset. For detailed results, refer to the project report.

# Future Enhancements
Integration with healthcare systems.
